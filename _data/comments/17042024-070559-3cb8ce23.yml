 I know from experience that sheet music can be very pricey. Therefore I could imagine someone trying to reproduce the sheets for copyrighted songs for a very low or no price at all by using Klangio (or the free trial available).
 So can the used AI in Klangio identify songs with copyright? Can it block the output?
