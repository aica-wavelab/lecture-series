 Could you explain if there is a connection between the AI-generated sounds (e.g., nature, human, etc.) in "META BODIES" and the placement of the patches on your body?
 I like your ideas in TECHNO BODIES. A growing tendency towards objectification encodes the body as an arbitrarily manipulable mass. Although I felt uncomfortable after I saw the exhibition on the website. But, this is what you would like to present.
