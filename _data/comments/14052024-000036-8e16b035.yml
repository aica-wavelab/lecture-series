 How successful are your projects/performances in terms of audience numbers, profits, or both? Have you seen an increase in interest and acceptance over time, or perhaps the opposite (with ai becoming less of a novelty and ethical issues arising). I also wonder what the demographic of your audiences is like, whether younger people are more likely to enjoy such experimental art.
