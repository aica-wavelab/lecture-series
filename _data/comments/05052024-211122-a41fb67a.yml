 The relationship between the instrument and performer is clearly the focus, but what about the perception and engagement of the audience? Do you think that the way listeners "interact" with performances will change when instruments take on a more autonomous/intelligent role? What would the dynamics be like, and would it be easy for audiences to adjust to this new type of music?
