text: "Innovative technology" is mentioned and so I am curious - what does Klangio do differently from, for example, AnthemScore's transcription with convolutional neural networks (2016)? This task seems more mathematical than anything, and so I wonder just how of a difference smaller machine learning improvements might be making.
