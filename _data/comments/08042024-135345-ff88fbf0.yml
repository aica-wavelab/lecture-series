text: "I saw the video which is ‘8. Limitations and Future Vision – Generative Music AI’ in your youtube channel. You said that solving the curse of DL is ‘Merge DL and symbolic AI’. 
But I read article from Autoblocks AI, it says ‘The main limitation of symbolic AI is its inability to deal with complex real-world problems. Symbolic AI is limited by the number of symbols that it can manipulate and the number of relationships between those symbols.’. 
So I’m wondering that when we consider this point, symbolic AI matches with generative music that have to consider melody, harmony and so on."
