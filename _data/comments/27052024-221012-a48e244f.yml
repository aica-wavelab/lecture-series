 How does the physical presence of these sculptures in the exhibition space influence the audience's perception and interaction compared to displays of purely digital content? The sculptures do not seem to be exact recreations of the AI generated content - do you create them with the intention of eliciting some specific reactions, like for example of being disturbed? Or are they the result of what the AI generated content makes you yourself feel?
