 Because the text is generated in the moment, do you think it would be an interesting idea, if viewer feedback is used to influence the play? (E.g. in the past people would throw rotten tomatoes or now they might leave the theatre if they are dissatisfied, but this way they would have a way to express emotions and the play would adapt)
