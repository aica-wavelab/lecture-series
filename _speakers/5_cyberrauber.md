talk: Neural Theater - artificial art in performing arts
talk_description: "AI is changing everything, but does this include theatre?  The German
collective CyberRäuber use artificial neural networks in theatre since
2019. With Prometheus Unbound in Linz they started an ongoing series in
artistic research that plays with the fundamentals of performing arts
with the aid of state of the art technology: Stage, sound, lights, but
most importantly the text of these performances are created, played,
interpreted in the moment.
In this talk, Marcel Karnapke and Björn Lengers talk about past, current
and future projects, lessons learned and their ideas for theatre."

Marcel Karnapke and Björn Lengers have been working together under the
name CyberRäuber as a digital performing arts collective since 2016.
According to "Theater der Zeit", their work is characterised by "a
unique mixture of affinity for technology, pioneering spirit, pragmatism
and love of theatre". Driven by curiosity and a belief in the great
future of theatre, they are experts in the digital exploration of
theatre traditions. Their work is shown internationally in theatres,
festivals and galleries.

Recent works include Things Fall Apart (a musical installation in mixed
reality, most recently at the London Film Festival), Solingen 1993
(Schauspielhaus Düsseldorf), Palast der Erinnerung (Stiftung
Humboldtforum) and Deus in machina - Ein Ritual (Staatstheater Nürnberg).
