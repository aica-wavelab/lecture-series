talk: "Transforming the Archive - museological exploration and curatorial strategies through artificial intelligence"
talk_description: "The GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) sector has been actively engaged for several years in the development of added values and processes that bring specific requirements of cultural data in museums and archives (AI4LAM 2024; Kohle 2018; Murphy et al. 2022; Neudecker 2022; Markus and Neudecker 2021; Caramiaux 2020). The focus is increasingly on added value and specific areas of application for the indexing and development of digital archives and digitally mediated museums (Bell and Ommer 2018; Bareither 2023; Caramiaux 2024; Thiel and Bernhardt 2024; Volland 2019). Collection development and curation processes in particular are changing due to the possibilities offered by the use of new machine learning methods. In multidimensional spaces, this enables new possibilities of access to digital knowledge bases (Pilka 2022; Bönisch 2021; ARCU&OHM 2021). Initial projects and research on working with language models also point in a promising direction (Badisches Landesmuseum Karlsruhe 2023; Philipps-Universität Marburg 2024). The presentation will analyse the advantages and disadvantages of previous strategies and provides an insight into the conditions for innovation developments at museums.
