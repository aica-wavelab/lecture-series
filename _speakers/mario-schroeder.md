Mario Schröder is a German dancer, choreographer, and ballet director.
He will introduce *Fusion*, a ballet performed at the Oper Liepzig he co-directed with the AI artist and musician Harry Yeff, better known as Reeps100. It was the world’s first ballet production activating AI art in every aspect of its design and choreography, and necessitating viewing as a bold step towards greater integration between human artists and their emergent AI counterparts.
