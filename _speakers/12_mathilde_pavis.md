talk: "Can I clone you with AI? A map of legal and ethical considerations involved in reproducing faces, voices and bodies with Artificial Intelligence."
talk_description: "The application of AI technology to generate what is now commonly referred to as a “deepfake” (ie. the creation of a person’s digital imitation with or without their consent using AI technologies) has caught the attention of creators, activists, policy-makers and citizens worldwide. Digital imitations are not new but AI enables a widespread practice of digitally cloning individuals which raises the question on whether there should be a basic ‘rule book’ to regulate when and how cloning is permissible. For example, should film-makers be allowed to replace actors with their clone at their own discretion? Can employers replace workers on strike or sick leave with an AI-generated clone? Should a grieving parent be allowed to create a digital clone of their deceased children? Can museums bring back the dead to make stories of the past more engaging to a new or younger audience? In this session, we will take a tour of the most recent developments in the digital cloning of people’s faces, voices and bodies with Artificial Intelligence. The discussion will cover recent technological advances, commercial ventures and ongoing industry debates. We will contrast this fast-moving picture with existing legal frameworks and more nuanced ethical debates on the topic.
