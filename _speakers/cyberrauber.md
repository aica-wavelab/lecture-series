The Theatre of Virtual Reality, founded by Marcel Karnapke and Björn Lengers, is a pioneering project that fuses the immersive world of virtual reality (VR) with the rich narrative tradition of theatre. Launched in May 2016 with their VR adaptation of Friedrich Schiller's “The Robbers,” their venture seeks to reinvent and reinvigorate theatre by making it accessible through VR, breaking the constraints of time and space. Their approach not only aims to bring theatre back into the limelight of civic society but also to harness the interactive potential of VR to tell compelling stories. Their repertoire includes theatre installations and plays available for VR devices, offering a unique blend of traditional storytelling and innovative technology.
