Valerio Velardo was a co-founder of Melodrive. Which was the first AI
music engine that generates video game music in realtime. In which the
generated soundtracks evolve endlessly and adapt their emotional
features, based on the narrative and visual state of the game. Now he is a
consultant and freelancer in the AI audio/music industry. He holds a
Senior Data Scientist position at Musimap, where he develops Machine
Learning algorithms for music analysis.

Since January 2020, he has been running The Sound of AI YouTube channel,
providing educational content on AI audio/music's technical and business
aspects. Valerio also founded The Sound of AI Slack Community, which
boasts around 2,000 members including learners, practitioners, and
researchers.

He is leading the OpenSource Research project, a collaborative research
initiative in AI music, involving hundreds of members from The Sound of
AI community. In which he develops new project management techniques for
coordinating large-scale, remote, voluntary teams.

Valerio's academic background is as diverse as it is impressive, holding
a PhD in AI Music and degrees in both music (composition, conducting,
piano performance) and astrophysics. He has a long-standing engagement
with programming and AI, research experience in music cognition, and a
deep interest in the philosophy of science.

He is an avid advocate of agile methodologies, clean code, test-driven
development, and the lean startup approach, with a strong belief in open
source and open science principles.
