Ivonne Thein (Berlin) is a multidisciplinary artist who works with the media of video, sculpture, performance, photography and mixed-media installations. In her practice, she reflects on the current body images of a digital culture that is fundamentally changing through extensive technologization. Based on stock photography, she started a collaboration with AI systems to explore the transformation of the physical body and its virtual representations in the visual culture of our time. Her works have been shown in international exhibitions, including at the Center Pompidou Paris, Fotomuseum Winterthur, Lentos Linz and CO Berlin.
