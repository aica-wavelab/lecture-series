talk: "Smart Hans, the endboss of AI : an artistic interactive installation"
talk_description: "Smart Hans is the endboss of all AI models. It is the digital reincarnation of the real horse clever Hans, which lived 100 years ago and fooled the people with its assumed cognitive capabilities like mind-reading. Our installation reveals how you can actually guess a persons thought in a controlled setting with the help of AI and a webcam. At the same time, the project warns us of the Clever-Hans-Effect, which describes the impossibility to ever reliably understand and anticipate an AI system's behaviour."
bloc: AI in visual and performing arts
